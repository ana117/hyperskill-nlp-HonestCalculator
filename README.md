# Honest Calculator
The International Union Against Idleness (IUAI) announced a competition for an application that would motivate users. There are prizes involved. Since you like competing and know a little bit about programming, you asked your friend to prepare an interesting algorithm for a quick buck. Unfortunately, you weren't clear enough, and instead of a ready-made program, a friend prepared a flowchart of Honest Calculator. You will have to put some effort into assembling it.

Learn how to read flowcharts to hone your understanding of loops, conditions, and algorithms. It will allow you to write your own algorithms. This skill also prevents multiple changes from occurring during production.

## Stages
**Stage 1/5: Data Collection**\
Collect data and check if users were attentive in school.

**Stage 2/5: First Calculations**\
Perform the first calculations and check if users know how to handle zero.

**Stage 3/5: Total Recall**\
Sometimes the numbers are so big that you have to store them. Implement this feature!

**Stage 4/5: The Laziness Test**\
Now, it is time to tell users what the calculator thinks about equations.

**Stage 5/5: Saving Memory**\
Electricity costs money, the processor overheats, the memory fills up, so you have to watch what users want to store.
